# Hangug-eo Seonsaengi.

### This project was built using [Wemake-Django-Template](https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-django-template) for best practice.

## Motivation

### I want to develop this helper to help my girlfriend to learn korean language with me. I learn it more easier than she could and I want to invest to her studying.
